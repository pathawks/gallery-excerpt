## Replace the excerpt for posts with the post type 'Gallery' to a row of images from the post.

Once activated, Gallery posts will have an excerpt that is a row of thumbnail images from that post, rather than some (often not descriptive) text.

This excerpt should appear in your archive pages, and perhaps elsewhere, depending on your theme.

**Note:** The post *must* actually have the post type 'Gallery'. It cannot just be a post with a gallery in it.
