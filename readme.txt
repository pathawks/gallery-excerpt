Replace the excerpt for posts with the post type 'Gallery' to a row of images from the post.

== Description ==

Once activated, Gallery posts will have an excerpt that is a row of thumbnail images from that post, rather than some (often not descriptive) text.
This excerpt should appear in your archive pages, and perhaps elsewhere, depending on your theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'Gallery-Excerpt' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate **Gallery Excerptl** through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
